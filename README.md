# Web Development Project 7 - Best Soccer Goals

Submitted by: Daniel Fernandez

This web app brings together a community of soccer fans, all of who can post what they think is a beautiful goal! Users can create/edit/interact/filter through all of the posts shown on the webpage.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The web app contains a page that features a create form to add a new crewmate**
  - Users can name the crewmate
  - Users can set the crewmate’s attributes by clicking on one of several values
- [x] **The web app includes a summary page of all the user’s added crewmatese**
  - The web app contains a summary page dedicated to displaying all the crewmates the user has made so far
  - The summary page is sorted by creation date such that the most recently created crewmates appear at the top
- [x] **A previously created crewmate can be updated from the list of crewmates in the summary page**
  - Each crewmate has an edit button that will take users to an update form for the relevant crewmate
  - Users can see the current attributes of their crewmate on the update form
  - After editing the crewmate's attribute values using the form, the user can immediately see those changes reflected in the update form and on the summary page
- [x] **A previously created crewmate can be deleted from the crewmate list**
  - Using the edit form detailed in the previous _crewmates can be updated_ feature, there is a button that allows users to delete that crewmate
  - After deleting a crewmate, the crewmate should no longer be visible in the summary page
  - [x] **Each crewmate has a direct, unique URL link to an info page about them**
    - Clicking on a crewmate in the summary page navigates to a detail page for that crewmate
    - The detail page contains extra information about the crewmate not included in the summary page
    - Users can navigate to to the edit form from the detail page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] A crewmate can be given a category upon creation which restricts their attribute value options
  - e.g., a Dungeons and Dragons class or a development team role (project manager, product owner, etc.)
  - User can choose a `category` option to describe their crewmate before any attributes are specified
  - Based on the category value, users are allowed to access only a subset of the possible attributes
- [ ] A section of the summary page, displays summary statistics about a user’s crew on their crew page
  - e.g., the percent of members with a certain attribute
- [ ] The summary page displays a custom “success” metric about a user’s crew which changes the look of the crewmate list
  - e.g., a pirate crew’s predicted success at commandeering a new galley

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added a like/dislike feature, which allows users to interact with the posts and show who agrees/disagrees with said goal
- [x] Added a filter which allows ALL or specific goals of a certain attribute to be shown on the dashboard
